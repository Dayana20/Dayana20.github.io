                <p>But today the scene and mirror no longer exist; there is a screen and network.

                <img src="pictures/tv.gif">
                <p>With the television image...our own body and the whole surrounding universe become a control screen</p>

                <p>We are here at the controls of a micro satellite in orbit living no longer as an actor or dramaturge but as a terminal of multiple networks</p>

                <p>It is our only architecture today: great screens on which are reflected atoms, particles, molecules in motion. Not a public scene or true public space but gigantic spaces of circulation, ventilation and epehemeral connections.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="b7">
            <p>It is the obscenity of what no longer has any secret, of what dissolves completely in information and communication.</p>

            <img id="head" src="pictures/head.gif.crdownload">
            <p>The most intimiate processes of our life become the virtual feeding ground of the media</p>
            <p>It is the end of interiority and intimacy, the overexposure and transpararence of the world which traverses him without obstacle. He can no longer produce the limits of his being, can no longer play nor stage himself, can no longer produce himself as mirror. He is now only a pure screen, a switching enter for all the networks of influence.</p>
